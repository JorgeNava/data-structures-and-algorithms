    "# Special String Generator\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description:**  \n",
    "Developers at Amazon are working on a text generation utility for one of their new products. Currently, the utility only generates *special strings*. A string is considered special if it contains no adjacent matching characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a string `s` of length `n`, generate a special string of the same length `n` that is lexicographically greater than `s`. If multiple such special strings exist, return the smallest one in lexicographical order.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Special String:**  \n",
    "  A string is special if no two adjacent characters are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lexicographical Order:**  \n",
    "  This is a generalized way of alphabetically ordering words as in dictionaries. For example, `\"abc\"` is lexicographically smaller than `\"abd\"` because `'c'` comes before `'d'` in the alphabet.\n",
    "\n",
    "A string `a` is lexicographically smaller than string `b` if one of the following holds:\n",
    "1. `a` is a prefix of `b`, but is not equal to `b`. For example, `\"abc\"` is smaller than `\"abcd\"`.\n",
    "2. At the first position where `a` and `b` differ, the character in `a` comes before the character in `b`. For example, `\"abc\"` is smaller than `\"abd\"` because `'c'` comes before `'d'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the character is `'z'`, it is the last character in the alphabet and cannot be increased further. The string should not wrap around to `'a'` after `'z'`.\n",
    "- The output string must not contain any adjacent characters that are the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Suppose:**  \n",
    "`s = \"abbd\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the special strings that are lexicographically greater than `\"abbd\"` are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `\"abca\"`\n",
    "- `\"abda\"`\n",
    "- `\"abcd\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "The smallest special string that is greater than `\"abbd\"` is `\"abca\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complete the function `getSpecialString` in the editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameter:**  \n",
    "- `s`: the input string.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Returns:**  \n",
    "- Return the lexicographically smallest string that is greater than `s`.\n",
    "- If no such special string exists, return `\"-1\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints:\n",
    "- \\(1 \\leq |s| \\leq 10^6\\)\n",
    "- `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Format for Custom Testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Input 0:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "s = \"abcde\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Output 0:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "abcdab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "Some of the special strings greater than `\"abcde\"` are `\"abcde\"`, `\"abcdab\"`, `\"abcdc\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Input 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "s = \"zzab\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Output 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "-1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**  \n",
    "There is no special string of length 4 that is lexicographically greater than `\"zzab\"`.\n"

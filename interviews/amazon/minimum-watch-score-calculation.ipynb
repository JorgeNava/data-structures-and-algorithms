    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysts at Amazon are studying trends in movies and shows popular on Prime Video to enhance the user experience. They have identified the **best critic-rated** and **best audience-rated** web series, represented by integer IDs `series1` and `series2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "They define the **watch score** of a contiguous period of days as the **number of distinct series watched** by a viewer during that period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an array `watch_history` of size `n`, representing the web series watched by a viewer over a period of `n` days, and two integers, `series1` and `series2`, report the **minimum watch score** for any **contiguous period** of days where both `series1` and `series2` are viewed at least once.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If `series1` and `series2` are the same value, only **one occurrence** during the period is sufficient.\n",
